- Dynamic Programming
- Others

## How to Use
1. Navigate to specific problem solution
2. Each solution includes:
   - Problem description
   - Approach explanation
   - Time & Space complexity
   - Solution code
```

4. Create an initial solution template:

````python
// filepath: src/main/solution_template.py
class Solution:
    """
    Template for LeetCode solutions
    """
    def solve(self):
        """
        Method description
        Time Complexity: O(?)
        Space Complexity: O(?)
        """
        pass
```
